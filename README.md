Amplifying your Web App with Native Code
========================================

Portable Native Client (PNaCl) and Emscripten compile C/C++ code for use as
part of the client side of your Web App. Because these technologies leverage
the security guarantees of the NaCl sandbox and Javascript respectively, they
donâ€™t require plugin installation or a user opt-in. This unlocks a 30+ year
treasure trove of C/C++ libraries and applications for use on the Web.
Additionally, since scripting languages like Python, Lua, Ruby, Tcl/Tk, and
Bash are implemented in C, the large body of code available in these languages
can also be integrated seamlessly into your app.

Learn how you can:
  * Develop Web Apps in the language you prefer.
  * Reuse the 200+ libraries and applications ported to Native Client.
  * Develop in your browser, including source control, editing, compilation,
    and debugging.
  * Move code off your server into the browser, for speed and security.
  * Maximize the performance of your application with native code.
